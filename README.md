Anything what helps to improve productivity with work on PC.

Lightweight python script to backup your favourite folder in different directory, for example USB drive, with one click.
You need to just define 3 very simple parameters:
  1. folder path to backup
  2. destination drive (eg. C:\\)
  3. destination folder path.

This script will create two folder backups: folder-copy and folder-copy-old, just to have an extra ability to rescue old folder after backup.

*The idea is to backup small folders, for example with most recent work, which you want to be backed up frequently.
