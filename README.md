Lightweight python script to backup your favourite folder in different directory, for example USB drive, with one click.
You need to just define 3 very simple parameters:
  1. folder location to backup
  2. destination drive (eg. C:\)
  3. destination folder.

This script will create two folder backups: folder-copy and folder-copy-old, just to have an extra ability to rescue old folder after backup.

*The idea is to backup small folders, for example with some files (all your codes...), which you want to be backed up frequently.
